# Wake up, it's the last day of our life
A multiple (or endless) endings gaming playing with time and decisions.

One of these endings is the path I've taken in real life. The game should have been finished in 2024 but I was in depression, and later it got kicked out of my schedule because I was too busy dealing with life itself rather than writting games about it. Ironically back in sometime in Feb 2024 I thought my life was dramatic, pathetic, and frankly speaking I didn't see hope back then in seeing sunrise the next day so I decided to write this game as my legacy. But 1 year later it turns out that it's myself who's the ultimate drama machine instead of my life anytime, and that 18 yo me lying in bed thinking world's gonna end is just way of winter (back then I was in northern hemisphere so yeah winter in Feb) pastime. Yet I find it obliged to pick it up and finish it, not because I missed the 18 yo me or ZTR, Emma, YL, Q, H or anyone in the script (yes they're based on people in real life but are light years away from me now anyway), but because I now find my true love of my life, and since I'm no longer a teenager anymore, I think it's high time to put an end to this chapter of my life.

Some original ideas but not much. Probably will be shit. But it's my first project about my teenager life and I'll cherish it no matter what.
